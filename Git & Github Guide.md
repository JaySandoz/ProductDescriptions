## Using Git and GitHub on a Mac

Here are the steps to use Git and GitHub on your Mac:

### Step 1: Install Git

1. Open the Terminal application on your Mac.
2. Check if Git is already installed by running the command: `git --version`
3. If Git is not installed, you will be prompted to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Step 2: Configure Git

1. Configure your name by running the command: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
2. Configure your email address by running the command: `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`

### Step 3: Create a New Repository

1. Create a new directory for your project by running the command: `mkdir project-name`
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command: `cd project-name`
3. Initialize a new Git repository by running the command: `git init`

### Step 4: Make Changes and Commit

1. Add files to the repository by running the command: `git add .`
2. Commit the changes with a descriptive message by running the command: `git commit -m "Commit message"`

### Step 5: Connect to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Copy the remote repository URL.
3. Connect your local repository to the remote repository by running the command: `git remote add origin remote-repository-url`
4. Push your commits to GitHub by running the command: `git push -u origin main`

### Step 6: Collaborate with Others

1. Invite collaborators to your GitHub repository.
2. Collaborators can clone the repository, make changes, and push them back to GitHub.

That's it! You're now ready to use Git and GitHub on your Mac for version control and collaborative development.
