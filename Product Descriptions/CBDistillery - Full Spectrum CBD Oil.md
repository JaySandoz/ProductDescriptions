CBD and THC are both cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant, but they have different effects on the body. CBD is non-psychoactive and has been found to have many potential health benefits, such as reducing anxiety, pain, and inflammation. THC, on the other hand, is psychoactive and can produce a feeling of euphoria.
